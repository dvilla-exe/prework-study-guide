# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide all started cause I was in need for a single, organized space to store my notes. I built this as a means to not only keep my notes organized by category, but also interacive as I study differnt facets of web app development. All notes I've made over HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript are stored here with ease of access.
